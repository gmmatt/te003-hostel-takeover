The GodNet intercepts and decodes all transmissions, so any business from the Council or the resistance is done in person or delivered by couriers to keep information off the grid. The runner is out of breath, indicating that this message is recent and very urgent. She hands a capsule to the Storm Knights, gives a small salute, and then sprints back the same way she came.</p><p>Inside the capsule is a hastily scribbled note with the following:</p><blockquote><p>A local resistance crew was involved in a skirmish with Church Police near Rue Jean Moulin and Avenue de la Marche. During the battle the team’s cyberwarlock accidentally summoned a demon. The demon fled during the chaos and they were too compromised to pursue it.</p><p>Proceed to the area, locate the demon, and eliminate it. Such a creature is pure malevolence and could do untold damage to innocent people. The Cyberchurch doesn’t seem to be active in the area. They are almost certainly waiting for the demon to do some damage so they can blame the resistance for summoning it.</p><p>This is Alpha Clearance and urgent. Bonne chance, Storm Knights.</p></blockquote><p>The note ends with a stamp, the Delphi Council seal.</p><h2>Rue Jean Moulin</h2><p>The intersection mentioned in the note is simple to find. The signs of battle are all over. Bullet holes from GodMeeter pisols riddle the walls and scorch marks remain from whatever weapons the resistance used. The street itself is barren of people and traffic in the violent aftermath.</p><p>The only person nearby is a shopkeeper repairing damage to his store’s sign. He dutifully ignores the Storm Knights unless approached. A successful <em>persuasion </em>test gets him to open up about what he saw, otherwise he closes his shop and locks his door.</p><p>The shopkeeper, Leon, witnessed some of the battle. Three strangers fought a dozen of the Church’s men: a short one in armor who shot fire from his arms, a man dressed in last century’s fashions, and the one who brought the demon. He shudders at the memory, and points in the general direction of where it happened. If asked to describe the demon he haltingly mutters something about the worst parts of a man and a worm, glistening with blood.</p><p>Even without Leon’s help a cursory investigation of the area discovers a thin layer of slime and dried blood where the demon appeared, and a trail of the same substance leading back into the alleys.</p><p>Finding and following the trail doesn’t require a test, but an Easy (DN 8) <em>find</em>, <em>evidence analysis</em>, or <em>tracking </em>test points out that the trail leads into a quiet residential area nearby.</p><h2>Le Hostel Petit</h2><p>The trail ends abruptly at sitting tables in a courtyard outside a large house. The home is actually a business, a hostel that caters to backpackers and youth traveling through the city. Those kinds of trips are unusual now that the Possibility Wars rage, so the place is mostly empty. There are pieces of broken furniture around, and a successful <em>evidence analysis </em>test reveals the wreckage was a rocking chair, unlike the other wooden chairs arranged around the tables.</p><p>The hostel is closed and the door locked. If the Storm Knights knock, a voice answers from the other side. He introduces himself as Pascale Petit, but informs the visitors that the hostel is closed. He sounds nervous and agitated. If asked about the broken furniture outside he lies clumsily, claiming a guest was sitting outside, went mad, broke the chair, and ran away. If the group accepts Pascale’s story and leaves to search for the guest, there’s a grunt and a thump from the second floor. Pascale swears softly.</p><p>It’s a Very Hard (DN 16) <em>persuasion </em>test to convince Pascale to let them inside to look around. The heroes gain a +2 bonus or more if they cook up a plausible story that paints them as authorities or knowledgable about demons. If the strangers can’t talk their way in, a Standard <em>lockpicking </em>test opens the lock. Breaking in through one of the large windows is simple and has the same effect. Pascale doesn’t try to physically resist the powerful-looking interlopers and doesn’t threaten to call the Church Police, which is suspicious in itself.</p><h3>Pascale Petit</h3><p>Pascale is the gentle owner of the hostel. He made a fair living running the place before the war and especially enjoyed cooking for people. He doesn’t believe in Malraux’s Cyberchurch, but also has no particular issue with it. He hasn’t had any cyberware upgrades installed and has a very low Piety score.</p><p>At first Pascale claims to run the hostel alone, but reverses himself if pressed after the characters look around and find evidence of his wife and mother. He knows the demon possessed his mother (see below), but doesn’t want the Church Police to come and take her away. He’s trying to keep his pious wife quiet until he can figure out how to save his mother. These intruders are yet another threat and obstacle as far as he’s concerned.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.te003-hostel-takeover.hostel-takeover-actors.qjyC5qzQn6ByRMjA]{Pascale Petit}</p><h2>Inside the Hostel</h2><p>Pascale rushes ahead of the heroes, nervously moving knick-knacks and blabbering about the backpacker who broke his chair outside. A standard <em>evidence analysis </em>test spots recent pictures of Pascale with his wife, Agnes, and his ailing mother, Constance. A Good Success spots items that belong to one or the other, and Outstanding Success finds traces that both still live here. If pressed, Pascale admits they still live here but are “out shopping.”</p><p>The entertainment room has several comfortable couches and a holographic projecter. Currently the projector is tuned to Jean Malraux’s sermon. The visage of the Cyberpope speaks in the background, preaching about sin.</p><blockquote><p>“Sin is everywhere, my children. On the streets, in our homes, and even within our very flesh. Sin must be cut away and burned like a cancer. If you see sin on the street, alert the Church Police. If you find sin in your home, cast it out. If you feel sin in your flesh, replace it with something clean and Godly. This is the One True Way.”</p></blockquote><p>If a Storm Knight moves to switch the projector off, an automated voice warns, “Changing channels during Cyberpope Malraux’s sermon is a trespass and deducts five points from your Piety Score. Do you wish to proceed?”</p><p>The kitchen is open, spacious, and well-stocked. The common room upstairs contains six bunk beds, each with its own footlocker. None of the beds are in use and all the lockers are empty, refuting Pascale’s story that a guest was here. The last two rooms are private and locked. An Easy (DN 8) <em>lockpicking </em>or <em>Strength </em>test opens either door. It’s also Easy (DN 8) to use <em>persusion </em>or <em>intimidation </em>to force Pascale to use his key.</p><h2>Pascal’s Room</h2><p>One of the upstairs rooms is the master bedroom. A thump sounds from inside once the visitors get near. Within is Agnes, Pascale’s wife, tied up and gagged. She squirms and makes desperate noises to get free.</p><p>Agnes is grateful if the Storm Knights release her, and begins crying about how her mother-in-law, Constance, has been possessed by a demon. Before any confrontation she tries to call the Church Police for help. Her mind is set, so it’s Hard (–4) to convince her to wait via <em>persuasion</em>, <em>intimidation</em>, or other means.</p><p>Pascale bursts into tears and confesses the truth at this point. He just wants to keep his family together and for things to go back like they were.</p><h3>Agnes Petit</h3><p>Agnes is Pascale’s wife. She’s a devout member of the Cyberchurch and a true believer. Most of the upgrades downstairs were won with her high Piety Score. Turning in a family member would earn her enough points for another upgrade.</p><p>Agnes’ neck and spine are cyberware, an elective upgrade she took to improve her posture. She wants to summon the Church Police to the hostel as soon as possible. She’s uncooperative once it’s apparent the Storm Knights are against Malraux. She loves her husband, but not enough to overlook his recent blasphemous behavior.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.te003-hostel-takeover.hostel-takeover-actors.1nOLnj2MKrzPkB98]{Agnes Petit}</p><h2>Constance</h2><p>Inside the last room, Pascale’s mother Constance sits quietly in her rocking chair, knitting something with red yarn. Pascale is surprised to see her knitting; she hadn’t been able to do that for years due to arthritis pain, and she refused the cyberware</p><p>hand replacements Agnes tried to secure for her.</p><p>When the strangers approach, they see Constance’s eyes are glassy. She looks up with a ghastly grin and speaks in a deep, masculine voice:</p><blockquote><p>“Hmph, you smell like heroes. I’ll offer you a deal. Just leave me alone. I’ll only murder a few people every now and then, and I’ll keep it quiet. You can’t defeat me without killing the old woman, so just let this one go.”</p></blockquote><p>When the heroes refuse, the demon sighs and stands up from the rocking chair to fight.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.te003-hostel-takeover.hostel-takeover-actors.S82VsjSY7Oh3ZLzO]{Constance}</p><h2>Zapar-Agentalus, Minor Demon</h2><p>Zapar-Agentalus is the demon’s name. It thrives on torture, murder, and lies. It actually intends to keep a low profile, but that still means a horrible death for occasional guests who stay at the hostel.</p><p>While it possesses Constance, her eyes are solid, glistening black and her lips and tongue are a deep red. It’s lying when it says it can’t be defeated without killing her. Once it takes eight Shock her body is KO’ed and Zapar-Agentalus must emerge to fight in its true form. If the fiend suffers a Wound, Constance also falls and the demon must emerge. If a hero manages to stabilize her with <em>first aid </em>within a round, or the Wound was dealt by non-lethal damage, she survives. If no one stabilizes her or the blow deals two more Wounds, Constance does indeed perish.</p><p>In its true form Zapar-Agentalus has a writhing, worm-like lower body. A thick, red slime that smells like blood drips from every inch of its exposed skin. The solid black eyes remain constant.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.te003-hostel-takeover.hostel-takeover-actors.SIIAZ1ZFvOSGEiUG]{Zapar-Agentalus}</p><h2>The Aftermath</h2><p>Once Zapar-Agentalus is KO’ed or defeated in its true form, it screams and melts into a pool of red ooze. The mission is complete. All that remains is dealing with what’s left of the Petit household. Any survivors are traumatized and unlikely to be grateful to the resistance or the Storm Knights. If the heroes linger too long the authorities finally arrive, thanks to Agnes or data transmitted by the house’s appliances.</p><ul><li><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.te003-hostel-takeover.hostel-takeover-actors.jjbUkMHKT6jrsNIS]{Cyberpriest}</strong></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.te003-hostel-takeover.hostel-takeover-actors.hVaTsRCwan0UMrQ3]{Church Police Streetbeaters} </strong>(2 per hero)</p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"_id":"vBOYb2dosi2Wc4kJ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":-100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.te003-hostel-takeover.hostel-takeover-journals.fbZOUvxH8vxcPwWa.JournalEntryPage.vBOYb2dosi2Wc4kJ"}}}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.itQ6pE3cgl2gsGGl"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"torgeternity","systemVersion":"2.6.8","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1663758530054,"modifiedTime":1663759005218,"lastModifiedBy":"4kr6bmxq7tmWuB59"},"_id":"itQ6pE3cgl2gsGGl","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"4kr6bmxq7tmWuB59":3}}
